# zcbor v. 0.5.0 (2022-06-13)

Any new bugs, requests, or missing features should be reported as [Github issues](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/zcbor/issues).

   * zcbor.py: Fix a bug preventing the "union_int" optimization from being applied.
   * zcbor.py: Expand the "union_uint" optimization to work on all integers, instead of only positive integers.

# zcbor v. 0.4.0 (2022-03-31)

**cddl-gen has been renamed to zcbor!**

Any new bugs, requests, or missing features should be reported as [Github issues](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/zcbor/issues).

## Improvements:

### CDDL language
 * Add support for 32-bit and 64-bit floating point numbers.
 * Add support for `undefined` in CDDL.
 * Add the CDDL prelude (from RFC 8610 Appendix D) to all builds (unless excluded with `--no-prelude`)
 * Add support for more complex `.cbor` and `.cborseq` expressions.


### Command line and Python module
 * Rename script/module to zcbor.
 * Better 64-bit support:
   * New argument: `--default-bit-size` which controls the assumed size of integers. See zcbor code `--help` for more information.
 * Add the `--include-prefix` option for path prefix to generated h files.
 * Allow using both `--encode` and `--decode` together to generate both at the same time.
 * Make changes to generated code to build with `-Wpedantic` and `-Wconversion`.


### C Libraries
 * All public function names have been prefixed with `zcbor_`.
 * Many function names have also been changed slightly.
 * Better API docs.
 * Add error value to state, which is populated when a function fails (returns `false`).
   * Add a `stop_on_error` feature that makes functions abort when an error has occurred (to avoid checking the output of all functions).
 * Add support for 32-bit and 64-bit floating point numbers.
 * Better 64-bit support:
   * New 64-bit integer decoding and encoding functions (in addition to existing 32-bit functions).
   * `uint32_t` usage has been largely transitioned to `size_t` or `uint_fast32_t` which are typically the same size as the architecture (32 or 64 bits).
   * This means that list/map/string sizes can be 64 bits on 64-bit architectures. Note that having 64-bit sizes on 32-bit architectures rarely make sense since they won't fit in the address space.
 * New helper macros for instantiating state variables: `ZCBOR_STATE_D()` and `ZCBOR_STATE_E()` for decoding and encoding respectively.
 * Add support for decoding payloads split over multiple memory chunks.
   * There are new APIs in zcbor_common.h and zcbor_decode.h to handle this. Look for `zcbor_update_state()` and various functions with `fragment` in the name.
   * Strings can be split between chunks, there is a new type `struct zcbor_string_fragment` for this purpose.
   * Data headers can not be split.
   * Backups to previous chunks cannot be restored.
 * Split `zcbor_multi_encode()` into `zcbor_multi_encode()` and `zcbor_multi_encode_minmax()`. The former is more useful for manual use, while the latter is for generated code.
 * Remove `zcbor_any_encode()` since it was just an alias for `zcbor_nil_put()`.
 * Rename `zcbor_string_type_t` to `struct zcbor_string`.
 * Rename `zcbor_state_backups_t` to `struct zcbor_state_constant`.
 * Add support for decoding and encoding `undefined` CBOR values.
 * `zcbor_any_decode()`:
   * Rename to `zcbor_any_skip()`
   * Add support for indeterminate-length arrays.
   * Have `zcbor_any_skip()` consume any tags that are present.
 * Introduce `zcbor_bstr_expect_ptr()`, `zcbor_bstr_put_ptr()`, `zcbor_tstr_expect_ptr()`, and `zcbor_tstr_put_ptr()`
 * zcbor_common.h: Add an enum (`zcbor_rfc8949_tag`) with some tag values.
 * Move CBOR intro text from zcbor_decode.h to README.
 * Control asserts separately from verbose (add ZCBOR_ASSERT option)
 * Introduce `zcbor_list_map_end_force_encode()` and `zcbor_list_map_end_force_decode()`.


### Tests
 * decode: Remove test4 since it hasn't been used or updated.
 * New unit test directory and project. Tests:
   * 64-bit vs 32-bit integers.
   * 64-bit vs 32-bit strings.
   * String encoding and decoding macros (`_lit()`, `_arr()`, `_term()`).
   * Payload chunks and string fragments.
 * Collect boilerplate Cmake code for tests into a new file test_template.cmake.
 * Add tests for draft-ietf-suit-manifest-16.
 * Rename "strange" tests to "corner_cases"
 * Build tests with `-Wpedantic` and `-Wconversion`

 * zcbor.py: Avoid creating functions with "None" result type.
 * src: Fix code so it builds correctly with asserts enabled.
 * zcbor_decode.c: Fix `list_map_start_decode()` to handle elem_count correctly
